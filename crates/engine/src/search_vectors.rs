///    64 to 512. The 16-dimension row measured 52.8 only because the 1 KiB floor
///    clipped its TopK 1 point.
///  * **Per returned vector: 4 bytes per dimension.** Projecting the vector added
///    exactly `40 * dimensions` at TopK 10, i.e. `4 * dimensions` per returned item,
///    which is one float32 per dimension. The previous model ignored this entirely,
///    so projecting the vector doubled the service's figure and changed nothing here.
///  * The **1 KiB floor** is unchanged and was reconfirmed: a 16-dimension search at
///    TopK 1 reported exactly 1024.
///
/// The 72 is split into a fixed 65 plus the returned item's own bytes, because the
/// caller already supplies `returned_non_vector_bytes` and a key-only item
/// contributes roughly 7 of those. That split is the one derived rather than
/// directly measured quantity here: it is corroborated by the richer items used in
/// an earlier probe, whose per-result figure was 102.6 for items carrying about
